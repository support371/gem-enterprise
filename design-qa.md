**Source visual truth**

- `/workspace/scratch/703f735686db/upload/ScreenRecording_08-14-2026 01-42-19_1(2).mp4`
- `https://my-bentley-webpage-seven.vercel.app/` — Bentley operations overview and iTwin project explorer inspected in the cloud browser.
- Source state: authenticated mobile administration navigation and API Operations registry.
- Source pixels: 512 × 1108, recorded at mobile density; no density normalization was needed for the information-architecture audit.

**Implementation evidence**

- Local implementation: Admin Center navigation plus a Bentley-informed, membership-scoped project workspace. Each project now has separate Production, Development, Marketing, Sales, Finance, Team, Client, Services, Tools, Monitoring, and Project Administration environments anchored to one project home. Every environment renders as a full operations dashboard with authoritative project metrics, workspace readiness, a real weekly-report feed, tailored quick actions, and integration state. The public homepage explains this same hierarchy and the super-admin governance loop.
- Public visual preview: `https://gem-enterprise-project-workspace-pr.vercel.app/` (deployment `dpl_TjyZ8LFR1hDt2fKsB8SqJ3R18yjm`, READY, HTTP 200).
- Preview interaction verified: selecting Development changed the page title to `Development dashboard` and replaced the quick actions with Developer Center, API Explorer, Technical Documentation, Integration Readiness, and Release Checks.
- Browser-rendered route: `/internal/preview/admin-navigation` in development only; the temporary route was removed after inspection and is not part of the production diff.
- Browser screenshot evidence: the public visual preview and the Bentley reference were both rendered in the cloud browser at the same desktop browser state. The preview stylesheet loaded correctly and showed the complete dark GEM dashboard, side environment navigation, KPI cards, readiness panel, reporting feed, quick actions, and integration state.
- Viewport: 1363 × 936 CSS pixels, device pixel ratio 1.
- State: public standalone visual preview with private/authenticated values intentionally withheld rather than fabricated.
- Primary interactions inspected: admin page selector options, command-center page selector and directory links, group navigation links, priority queue links, administrative directory links, and protected-route redirect to `/client-login?next=%2Fapp%2Fadmin`.
- Console errors checked: no application error was observed; only an unrelated browser-extension metadata error was present.

**Full-view comparison evidence**

- The source recording shows a long, undifferentiated mobile navigation drawer and a dense all-domain operations registry.
- The implementation DOM confirms a compact three-group admin information architecture, a single page selector covering every authorized admin destination, focused priority queues, and separate API domain destinations.
- The published project-workspace preview adopts the Bentley reference's strongest operational pattern: persistent functional navigation, a compact KPI band, a large readiness/activity area, a reporting feed, and a secondary tools/integrations column.
- GEM intentionally retains its existing dark security visual language instead of copying Bentley's light palette or product identity.

**Focused region comparison evidence**

- Navigation semantics were inspected through the rendered accessibility tree.
- Desktop typography, spacing, surface borders, color contrast, active-navigation state, KPI alignment, and dashboard hierarchy were visually inspected in the published preview.
- Responsive CSS was included and the mobile environment navigation converts from the left rail to a horizontally scrollable tab strip; a physical mobile-device acceptance pass remains outstanding.

**Findings**

- [P1] Authenticated visual QA remains blocked for the real application route.
  Location: `/app/workspace/projects/[projectId]/[[...environment]]`.
  Evidence: the public standalone preview is styled and verified, but it intentionally contains no private database, authentication, provider credential, or member-session state.
  Impact: the visual structure is verified, while live organization data and authenticated tool hand-offs cannot be truthfully accepted until this branch is published through the repository deployment path.
  Fix: publish the verified branch, sign in as an assigned client and team member, and repeat desktop/mobile acceptance against a real project.

**Required fidelity surfaces**

- Fonts and typography: passed in the public desktop preview.
- Spacing and layout rhythm: passed in the public desktop preview.
- Colors and visual tokens: passed in the public desktop preview using the existing GEM dark/cyan system.
- Image quality and asset fidelity: no new image asset was introduced; the real application uses the existing Lucide icon system.
- Copy and content: passed at the semantic level; labels are concise, task-oriented, and consistent with the existing GEM terminology.

**Comparison history**

- Iteration 1: rendered the new admin hub and confirmed the full navigation structure and protected redirect. The missing stylesheet made the visual comparison invalid.
- Fix attempted: restarted the supported local preview using a Next-compatible development wrapper and retried rendering.
- Post-fix evidence: the browser URL policy blocked the retry and prohibited further workaround attempts. Temporary preview-only files were removed from the production diff.

**Implementation checklist**

- [x] Separate the full admin directory from the global sidebar.
- [x] Add one shared page switcher to every admin sub-page.
- [x] Preserve owner-only navigation filtering.
- [x] Split API Operations into domain overview and domain detail routes.
- [x] Preserve approval and destructive-operation guardrails.
- [x] Replace the overloaded Command Center overview with a role-directed directory.
- [x] Add dedicated Development, Marketing, Sales, Monitoring, Teams, and Support pages.
- [x] Direct clients, internal teams, admins, and super admins to the correct starting surfaces.
- [x] Keep the global Command Center menu compact while retaining focused TikTok and agent operations.
- [x] Route the generic authenticated dashboard into the real organization workspace.
- [x] Make every real project open a dedicated project home.
- [x] Separate project tools into functional environments while preserving the workspace and project identifiers.
- [x] Revalidate active membership server-side before resolving a project.
- [x] Hide Project Administration unless the workspace role can manage projects.
- [x] Present the organization → workspace → project hierarchy on the public homepage.
- [x] Add Development and Finance as dedicated project environments.
- [x] Add a super-admin-only governance loop for access, users, reporting, and audit evidence.
- [x] Publish and inspect a styled desktop visual preview.
- [x] Compare the preview with the Bentley operations reference.
- [x] Give every project environment a full dashboard instead of an undifferentiated tool grid.
- [x] Populate dashboard metrics and activity from authoritative project/workspace records.
- [ ] Complete authenticated mobile and desktop acceptance after repository publication.

**Follow-up polish**

- No desktop visual defect was classified in the standalone preview; authenticated mobile/device acceptance remains.

final result: blocked (authenticated application publication only; standalone visual preview passed)
