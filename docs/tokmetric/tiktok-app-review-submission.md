# TikTok App Review Submission — Alliance-Trust Hub / TokMetric

## Copy for “Explain how each product and scope works”

Use this text in the TikTok review form. It is under the 1,000-character limit:

> Alliance-Trust Hub uses TikTok Login Kit so a user can connect their own TikTok account through TikTok OAuth. The `user.info.basic` scope is used to show the connected creator username and nickname. TokMetric uses the Content Posting API with `video.publish` only after the user selects an approved video, refreshes the creator settings, edits the caption, chooses one of TikTok’s returned privacy options, configures comments/Duet/Stitch and commercial or AI-content disclosures, confirms video and music rights, and expressly clicks “Send video to TikTok.” Local files upload directly from the user’s browser to TikTok’s temporary upload URL. The app then polls TikTok’s status endpoint and shows processing, success, or failure. TikTok passwords and access tokens are never displayed or stored in the browser. Sandbox demonstrations use `SELF_ONLY` privacy.

## Products to select

Select only the products demonstrated in the recording:

- Login Kit
- Content Posting API — Direct Post

Do not select Display API, Share Kit, TikTok Shop, Business API, or advertising products unless the submitted recording demonstrates those products end to end.

## Scopes to request

- `user.info.basic`
- `video.publish`

Do not request `video.upload` for this Direct Post review flow. `video.upload` is used for the separate upload-to-inbox/draft experience and is not required by the implemented Direct Post workflow.

## Demo video recording sequence

Record one continuous MP4 or MOV video showing:

1. The browser address bar displaying the verified GEM domain.
2. Sign-in to the GEM Enterprise review account.
3. Open `/tokmetric/publishing`.
4. Select the review workspace.
5. Select the connected TikTok sandbox account.

10. Edit the caption.
11. Choose `SELF_ONLY` for sandbox review.
12. Show the comments, Duet, Stitch, paid-partnership, own-business, and AI-generated-content controls.
13. Manually check all four consent and rights confirmations.
14. Click **Send video to TikTok**.
15. Show upload progress.
16. Show TikTok processing status in TokMetric.
17. Open the authorized TikTok sandbox/test account and show the resulting private post after processing completes.
18. Briefly show the public Privacy Policy and Terms of Service pages.

The recording must show real clicks and a real sandbox API request. Do not submit only static mockups or narrated slides.
