# GEM Human Approval Register

Reconciled `2026-08-10T19:11:25Z` in `CODEX_CLOUD` at commit `2a2f7eac1dd7c731eccc165d758be25147977918`. An action is not repeated after satisfaction; credentials, tokens, personal data, and secret values must never be recorded here.

## HA-001 — Repository and PR read authorization

- **State:** PARTIALLY SATISFIED
- **Reason:** The task context establishes that draft PR #291 exists, satisfying PR creation. This workspace still has no Git remote and `gh` is unauthenticated, so its live state and inline comments cannot be verified.
- **Exact component:** Draft PR #291 in `support371/gem-enterprise`.
- **Actual evidence:** User-provided PR number/state; local exact artifact commit `2a2f7eac1dd7c731eccc165d758be25147977918`; `gh pr view` returned an authentication error.
- **Required remaining evidence:** Authorized read access or a sanitized export showing PR URL, current head/base, updated time, inline comments, reviews, checks, linked issue, and canonical preview.
- **What Codex already proved:** The four existing artifacts come from exact local commit `2a2f7eac1dd7c731eccc165d758be25147977918`; protected files did not drift from the recorded baseline.
- **What Codex must do after approval:** Reconcile PR evidence to the exact SHA, address actual inline comments minimally, and update rather than recreate these artifacts.

## HA-002 — Canonical Vercel preview verification

- **State:** OPEN
- **Reason:** Only the canonical Vercel Git integration may provide the hosted preview gate; no second production deployment is authorized.
- **Exact component:** Vercel project `support371-gem-enterprise` for PR #291.
- **Required evidence:** Canonical preview identifier, exact commit SHA, successful preview verification/build logs, affected-route checks, and previous valid deployment identifier.
- **What Codex already proved:** Repository-side protected configuration did not drift and no duplicate deployment was initiated.
- **What Codex must do after approval:** Inspect authorized preview evidence, bind it to the exact commit, run non-destructive smoke checks, and update the ledger without deploying production.

## HA-003 — Production database ownership and migration-state confirmation

- **State:** OPEN
- **Reason:** Production database access and migration execution are owner-controlled and must not be mutated from CI.
- **Exact component:** PostgreSQL/Prisma production persistence.
- **Required evidence:** Accountable owner, sanitized migration status, compatibility assessment, readable backup/restore evidence, migration-specific rollback implications, and explicit execution approval if needed.
- **What Codex already proved:** 32 migration files and the unchanged schema hash exist; no database was mutated. Both required database environment-variable names are absent in this process.
- **What Codex must do after approval:** Compare authorized migration state and run safe compatibility and repeated request checks without promoting persistence based only on repository files.

## HA-004 — GEM Studio Windows runtime and real-call acceptance

- **State:** OPEN
- **Reason:** `CODEX_CLOUD` cannot inspect Windows-local media state, while actual visual/audio acceptance requires a consented human.
- **Exact component:** GEM controller, Pinokio/Decart, OBS/WebSocket/Virtual Camera, Voicemod, and real call flow.
- **Required evidence:** Positive `GEM_ASSIST_WINDOWS` classification; protected configuration hashes; resource and controller security results; bounded soak log; process/listener ownership; recovery behavior; consented visual/audio acceptance.
- **What Codex already proved:** No Windows or media readiness claim was made and no Windows mutation occurred.
- **What Codex must do after approval:** Baseline before mutation, run the controller security matrix, observe sustained readiness, distinguish network from dependency failure, and record human acceptance separately.

## HA-005 — News Forge content and publication approval

- **State:** OPEN
- **Reason:** Story rights, identity/consent, speech acceptance, and publication are governance decisions.
- **Exact component:** News Forge story-to-speech/publication flow.
- **Required evidence:** Owner-approved story, rights and identity/consent confirmation, controlled speech E2E result, and explicit publication approval.
- **What Codex already proved:** Nothing was activated and the dependency remains `HUMAN_REQUIRED`.
- **What Codex must do after approval:** After security and preview prerequisites pass, run one controlled E2E test and keep automatic publication disabled absent separate approval.

## HA-006 — Notion provider consent and controlled publication

- **State:** OPEN
- **Reason:** Provider consent, publication identity, and approval cannot be inferred.
- **Exact component:** Notion integration and publication target.
- **Required evidence:** Owner-granted consent, approved secret storage, negative publication test, one positive controlled-record test, identity/consent approval, and explicit publication approval.
- **What Codex already proved:** No provider credential or secret value was inspected, logged, or activated.
- **What Codex must do after approval:** Prove rejection before success, constrain scope, retain sanitized evidence, and preserve credential-revocation rollback.

## HA-007 — Release-candidate ownership and freeze approval

- **State:** OPEN
- **Reason:** Release approval cannot precede automated, cloud, local runtime, security, rollback, provider, and governance evidence.
- **Exact component:** Final GEM evidence dossier and release-candidate freeze.
- **Required evidence:** Exact repository/branch/commit, package version, build hash, deployment artifact, controller package SHA-256, complete evidence directory, rollback validation, and owner sign-off.
- **What Codex already proved:** Current evidence supports `NO-GO`; no candidate, production deployment, or activation was declared.
- **What Codex must do after approval:** Freeze only after prerequisites pass; any release-blocking fix creates a new candidate and reruns affected tests.
